                <div> Dear Eileen,<br>
                Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your question one by one,in the following sections.</div><br>
<div><h2>Starting dates</h2></div><br>
<div> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;the start date for each one are follows:
<div>               
<ul>
       <li>First semester:9 september 2016</li>    
       <li>second semester:15 january 2017</li>
       <li>Third semester:2 may 2017</li>
   </ul>

you can find more information about important university dates on our websites.
<div><h2>Subjects of study </h2>                    
<div>At ausome science faculity,we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,dedicated resercher,and just the kind of a person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the idea you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
     <ol>                                         
     <li>Truning H2O into wine,and the healt benefits of Resveratrol(C14H12O3)                                          
     <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaters at temperatures exceeding 30 degree C (86 F),when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3*10^3 increasing to 3*10^4).
     <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
     </ol> 
</div>                                              
<div>sp please you can provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resiurces, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
<div><h2>Exotic dance moves </h2>  
<div>yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitiond:</div><br>

<div>polynesian chicken dance </div> 
<divclass="a">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village wold dance around in circle like chickens, to encorahe their livestock to be "fruitful".</div> 
<div>iceladic brownian shuffle</div>
<divclass="b">Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements. one of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as ywerking</div>
<div>Arctic robot dance</div>
<divclass="c">An intresting example of historic misiniformation,English explores in the 1060s belived to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants of northern alsaka and canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moveing like this because they were really cold.</div><br>
<div>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</div><br>
<div>Yours sincerely</div><br>
